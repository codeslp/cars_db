    "- ✅ Check for nulls, fill if possible from name field?\n",
    "- ✅ Strip extra spaces\n",
    "- ✅ Convert all case to lower case\n",
    "- ✅ Eliminate duplicate entries\n",
    "- ✅ Remove all non-numeric chars from numeric fields\n",
    "- ✅ Make date fields date objects\n",
    "- ✅ Standardize as many fields as possible\n",
    "\n",
    "1. ✅ Eliminate duplicated information from the table: make, model, year, engine size--basically if the field exists anywhere else in the row, then we have to cut it from the name field. Occasionally there is information in the name field that is not anywhere else in the row, so we can't throw out the field altogether.\n",
    "2. ✅ Change mileage from str to int\n",
    "3. ✅ Change num_owners from str eg \"1st\" to int eg 1\n",
    "4. ✅ Cut transmission_gears from str eg \"5-speech\" to int eg 5 and 'cvt' (continuous transmission to 'c')\n",
    "5. ✅ Change transmission_type from str \"Manual\" or \"Automatic\" to \"M\" or \"A\"\n",
    "6. ✅ Cut emission type from \"BS V\" to just \"5\"\n",
    "7. ✅ Change price to int\n",
    "8. ✅ Change fuel type to just first letter\n",
    "9. ✅ Try to standardize Engine_Type field, eliminate duplicate data\n",
    "10. ✅ Split out multiple data points from Engine_Type field (also move out drive train bc this is not engine data). Could split our cylinders number, turbo boolean, valve number\n",
